Middlewar always run before every request... (use for authetication for example)


built in --> provided by express  static||JSON||urlencodes
// To use built in middlewar in express we use app.use(middleware name) 
//example app.use(express.json());

third party -> bodyParcel || CORS || Cookie_parser
custom -> which is made me own



1st req.
2st req.
app.use(middlewar)
3st req.
4st req.
// the middle war only use after 2nd request 
// means middleware not use for 1,2 request


3.creating custom middlewar

function log(req,res,next)
{	
	console.log(req.url);
	next(); // next will send to next middlewar or next route
	// if we not write this then page get loading again and again
}
//to use this custom middle war
//we use app.use(log);


// If I Want to use middlewar only for a particular request 
req.get("route(api/user/)", middlewarName||function , eventHandler(req,res)=>{});
// we use this before eventHandler
